# Provision

## Provision Vagrant with Ansible

### Comments

> Greetings<br>
> I wanted to begin my comments by thanking you for this challenge.  I am familiar with some of the technology used but do not use them on a daily basis.  This assignment was a very practical challenge that could be applied in a real life business solution.  I have learned many new skills from completing this assignment and am grateful for the opportunity.

### Part one

> NGINX config
>> I focused on using simple methods to accomplish the task while applying best practices and security.
>
>> Any 'http' request to the server would be forwarded to 'https://127.0.0.1:443'.  This would ensure proper ssl tls connections on all requests.
>
>> Based on research, I used 'TLSv1.2 & TLSv1.3' for ssl protocols (https://www.calcomsoftware.com/leaving-tls1-2-using-tls1-3/#:~:text=The%20most%20widely%20used%20versions,is%20thus%20recommended%20for%20use)
>
>> Also based on research, i used these recommended ssl ciphers: 'ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384' (https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html)
>
>> It is advisable to assign the max-age directiveâ€™s value to be greater than 10368000 seconds (120 days).  Therefore I used the option 'Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always'.
>
>> I set 'ssl_verify_depth' as '1' because there is only one cert and the path to it is absolute.

### Part two

> Ansible playbook
>> I created and placed the nginx.conf in the following directories:
>> <br>/usr/local/nginx/conf
>> <br>/etc/nginx
>> <br>/usr/local/etc/nginx
>> <br>The reason was because, these are the standard locations for the nginx.conf file, so to ensure proper configuration I assumed the use of all three directories could be possible.  After which the permissions were changed to owned as root:root and 744.
>
>> Ther certificate was placed in '/etc/pki/tls/certs/' and the key was placed in '/etc/pki/tls/private/'.  According to a trusted source on stackoverflow.com "The directory permissions should be 700, the file permissions on all the files should be 600, and the directory and files should be owned by root."
>
>> In order to make the 'run' bash script into a system service i wrote a config 'service.txt' on the host server to be written to '/etc/systemd/system/application.service' on the vagrant server.  After which the permissions were changed to match the services in the same directory.  I also added the service to the startup procedures, assuming it would be used in the future.
>
>> After restarting nginx, I had the playbook print the status of both nginx and the application to ensure the user that both needed services were up and running.

### Instructions
- Run the following command:
```
